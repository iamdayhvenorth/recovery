                We talk endlessly about CFD (contracts for difference) scams and
                how to avoid them. We’ve done surveys on what people do when
                they spot fake investment ads online, written guides about how
                to avoid getting hoodwinked by commission-driven advisory
                brokers, explained that trading educators are best avoided, yet
                still investors are being lured into offshore CFD scams.

                Thankfully the FCA is now stepping up its game and banning
                Cypriot based brokers from passporting into the UK FCA register.
                One of the major sources of these CFD scams is unregulated
                social media advertising. Even though Facebook, Twitter, Google
                have banned advertising CFDs for non-regulated brokers. Scam CFD
                adverts are still slipping through the net.

              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                The problem is not with CFDs, which are a legitimate investment
                and trading product. They work on the basis that you trade on
                leverage and your profit and loss is based on the difference
                between the opening and closing price you trade at. CFDs provide
                a mechanism for high risk investing on liquid assets such as
                forex, indices, stocks, commodities and interest rates. They
                have been around for decades, but have gradually become more
                readily available. When I first started as a CFD broker at Man
                Financial (then a FTSE 100 company) I sat across the aisle from
                GNI headed by Phil Adler, (who pioneered online CFDs through
                their platform GNI Touch) CFDs were only available to clients
                who had a net worth (excluding principal residence of at least
                £100,000, and had significant experience with high-risk
                investments. In effect, back then, CFDs were self-regulated. In
                that it took weeks to open an account, you had to fill in paper
                forms, post ID, provide financial statements and also have a
                minimum account balance of £10,000 before you would be allocated
                an account number.

              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                There was also no social media so there were no Instagram
                investment scams of posers with Gucci trainers, Lamborghini’s
                claiming to trade by the pool for two hours a day – the
                so-called traders’ lifestyle. The FCA even joined Instagram to
                try and highlight how these scams work. But now, pretty much
                anyone can open an account and trade CFDs within a few minutes.
                AML checks are done when you want to withdraw funds (leading to
                loads of complaints about clients claiming brokers are refusing
                to send their money back). Which means that anyone can trade
                CFDs. But just because everyone can trade CFDs it doesn’t mean
                everyone should. We maintain a comparison of UK regulated CFD
                brokers, client reviews and CEO interviews so you can make a
                more informed decision about which CFD trading platform to use.
                Ever since ESMA (the European equivalent of the FCA) told all
                FCA regulated brokers that they to display the percentage of
                clients who lose money trading CFDs with them on their websites
                and marketing material it’s become clearer than ever that
                high-risk investment products are not for everyone. But, then
                again, the quicker you try and make money, you have to accept
                that you can lose it just as quickly. So the product is
                high-risk, yes, but it is a self-directed, execution-only
                product. The FCA rules say that you cannot advise clients what
                to invest in, even if it’s implied advice. Which means that
                clients make their own investment decisions. If they lose money
                they are the ones that have pulled the trigger.

                How do CFD Scams Work ?

                In some cases to generate more commission on each trade for
                them. These were the sorts of scams being run in films like Wolf
                of Wall Street and Boiler Room.
              </p>
              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                In the worst cases, CFD scammers try and get clients to
                deliberately lose money. Scam CFD brokers earn money from
                deliberately encouraging their clients to deposit and lose funds
                by not hedging client positions. This means that the trades are
                imaginary and they are acting more like a bookie rather than a
                broker.

                How do scammers use the FCA to promote a CFD scam?
              </h2>
              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                It’s now so easy to set up a brokerage that appears to be
                legitimate and use social media to entice clients that the FCA
                has started to take action. In the past, off shore CFD brokers
                could register for regulation in Cyprus and be passported into
                the UK’s FCA register. Meaning that when potential clients check
                to see if the firms are legitimate or not they appear on the FCA
                register.
              </p>
              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                So checking to see if a firm is FCA regulated is not enough to
                determine if it is a scam or not. Using the FCA is one of the
                biggest tools in a scammer’s handbook. If a firm appears to have
                been vetted by the FCA, investors are more likely to be scammed.
                The FCA is now taking action to try and stop Cypriot and
                offshore firms passporting into the UK.

                As with all scams, common sense should prevail, but scammers are

                Keep these golden rules in mind if considering trading CFDs :
              </p>

              <ol className="list-decimal flex flex-col gap-4">
                <li className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] ml-4">
                  <strong>Never trust lifestyle ads.</strong> CFD brokers are
                  not allowed to adverts it as a lifestyle product. These are
                  most likely from affiliate trying to get you to buy into their
                  trading course or refer you to an offshore unregulated broker.
                </li>
                <li className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] ml-4">
                  <strong>Cold calls are a warning sign.</strong> If you get a
                  call from a pushy salesman, hang up and report them instantly.
                  It’s an immediate red flag. Legitimate brokers do call new
                  clients to welcome them to the service so not all calls from
                  CFD brokers are a scam, but there is a clear difference
                  between a welcome call and someone phoning you up on a crackly
                  line to suggest you can “make a second income from forex
                  trading”.
                </li>
                <li className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] ml-4">
                  <strong>No risk warning.</strong> If you see online ads that
                  don’t contain a risk warning avoid them and report them. We
                  have covered in the past that the requirement for risk
                  warnings leads to risk warning fatigue, meaning that people
                  start ignoring legitimate adverts and being more inclined to
                  be seduced by ads without a risk warning.

                <li className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] ml-4">
                  <strong>No FCA regulation.</strong> Even though we just said
                  that FCA is no guarantee something isn’t a scam – just look at
                  London Capital & Finance and their £230m mini-bond scam. But
                  it’s a good place to start your online due diligence.

                  <strong>Never bow to pressure.</strong> No legitimate CFD
                  broker will ever pressurize you to open an account. The days
                  of churn and burn clients are over. Decent CFD brokers want to
