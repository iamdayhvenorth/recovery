                Much of the binary options market operates through
                Internet-based trading platforms that are not necessarily
                complying with applicable regulatory requirements and may be
                engaging in illegal activity.+ Investors should be aware of
                fraudulent promotion schemes involving binary options and binary
                options trading platforms.

                What is a Binary Option?
              </h2>
              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                A binary option is a type of options contract in which the
                payout depends entirely on the outcome of a yes/no proposition
                and typically relates to whether the price of a particular asset
                will rise above or fall below a specified amount. +Once the
                option is acquired, there is no further decision for the holder
                to make regarding the exercise of the binary option because
                binary options exercise automatically. +Unlike other types of
                options, a binary option does not give the holder the right to
                buy or sell the specified asset. +When the binary option
                expires, the option holder receives either a pre-determined
                amount of cash or nothing at all.

                Investor Complaints Relating To Fraudulent Binary Options
                Trading Platforms The SEC has received numerous complaints of
                fraud associated with websites that offer an opportunity to buy
                or trade binary options through Internet-based trading
                platforms. +The complaints fall into at least three categories:

                    customers.
                  </strong>
                  These complaints typically involve customers who have
                  deposited money into their binary options trading account and
                  who are then encouraged by "brokers" over the telephone to
                  deposit additional funds into the customer account. +When
                  customers later attempt to withdraw their original deposit or
                  the return they have been promised, the trading platforms
                  allegedly cancel customers' withdrawal requests, refuse to
                  credit their accounts, or ignore their telephone calls and
                  emails.

                  information (including copies of customers' credit cards,
                  passports, and driver's licenses) for unspecified uses. +Do

                  These complaints allege that the+Internet-based binary options
                  trading platforms manipulate the trading software to distort
                  binary options prices and payouts. +For example, when a

                  extended arbitrarily until the trade becomes a loss. Beware of

                Additionally, some binary options Internet-based trading
                platforms may overstate the average return on investment by
                advertising a higher average return on investment than a
                customer should expect, given the payout structure.
              </p>
              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                For example, a customer may be asked to pay $50 for a binary
                option contract that promises a 50% return if the stock price of
                XYZ company is above $5 per share when the option expires.+
                Assuming a 50/50 chance of winning, the payout structure has
                been designed in such a way that the expected return on
                investment is actually+negative, resulting in a+net loss+to the
                customer. +This is because the consequence if the option expires
                out of the money (approximately a 100% loss) significantly
                outweighs the payout if the option expires in the money
                (approximately a 50% gain). +In this example, an investor could
                expect — on average — to lose money.
