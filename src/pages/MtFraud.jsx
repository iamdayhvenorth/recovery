                Standby Letter of Credit (SBLC)/ Bank Guarantee (BG) is a
                guarantee of payment issued by a bank on behalf of a client that
                is used as “payment of last resort” should the client fail to
                fulfill a contractual commitment with a third party. Standby
                letters of credit are created as a sign of good faith in
                business transactions and are proof of a buyer’s credit quality
                and repayment abilities.
              </p>
              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                The bank issuing the SBLC performs brief underwriting duties to
                ensure the credit quality of the party seeking the letter of
                credit, then sends notification to the bank of the party
                requesting the letter of credit (typically a seller or
                creditor). A standby letter of credit shows a company’s credit
                quality and ability to repay loans. Although SBLC/BG is not
                intended for use as a replacement for immediate cash payment
                obligation, it helps fulfill business obligations in case the
                business stops operations, cannot pay its vendors or becomes
                insolvent.Small businesses often face difficulty when securing
                financing. For this reason, Standby Letters of Credit may be
                especially beneficial for encouraging investors to lend money to
                such a company.
              </p>
              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                In case of default, investors are assured they will be paid the
                principal and interest from the bank through which the SBLC/BG
                is secured. Standby Letters of Credit are issued for use in a
                wide variety of commercial and financial operations. Standby
                Letters of Credit are very much alike Documentary Letters of
                Credit (DLC). The main difference between a Documentary Letter
                of Credit and a Standby Letter Of Credit being that unlike DLCs,
                SBLCs only become operative in case the applicant defaults. In
                case of default, the beneficiary in whose favor the SBLC was
                issued, can draw on the SBLC and demand payment. Historically,
                Standby Letters of Credit were developed because the US
                regulator legally limited US bank’s authority to issue Bank
                Guarantees.
              </p>
              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                SBLCs are also very similar to Bank Guarantees (BG), which too
                require that the presentation of stipulated documents be
                compliant with the terms and conditions of the Bank Guarantee.
                SBLC’s and Bank Guarantees are different in terms of protection,
                they both serve the primary purpose of making sure that sellers
                get paid, but while a Standby Letter of Credit protects the
                seller, a Bank Guarantee (BG) protects both sides, since it also
                protects the buyer in case the supplier never ships the goods or
                ships them in a damaged condition.
              </p>
              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                When requesting a SBLC, a business owner proves to the bank he
                is capable of repaying the loan. Collateral may be required to
                protect the bank in case of default. The bank typically provides
                a letter to the business owner within one week of receiving
                documentation. The business owner must pay a SBLC fee for each
                year that the letter is valid. The fee is typically 1-10% of the
                SBLC value. If the business owner meets the criteria outlined in
                the contract before the due date, the business owner can cancel
                the SBLC without further charges.Standby Letters of Credit
                (SBLC) are a very flexible tool, making them a suitable product
                for securing a wide range of payment scenarios
              </p>
              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                A financial SBLC, the most common type, is typically used in
                international trade or other high-value purchase contracts where
                litigation or other non-payment actions may not be feasible. A
                financial SBLC guarantees payment to the beneficiary if criteria
                outlined in the contract are left unfulfilled. For example, an
                exporter sells goods to an overseas buyer who guarantees payment
                in 30 days. When the payment does not appear by the deadline,
                the exporter presents the SBLC to the importer’s bank and
                receives the payment.A performance SBLC ensures the time, cost,
                amount, quality of work and other criteria are fulfilled in a
                manner acceptable to the client. The bank pays the beneficiary
                if any of the written obligations are unmet. For example, a
                contractor guarantees a construction project will be finished in
                90 days. If work remains incomplete after the 90-day period, the
                client can present the SBLC to the contractor’s bank and receive
                the payment due.
              </p>
              <p className="font-open-sans text-base font-normal text-[#5f5f5f] mb-5">
                The SBLC should not be confused with the documentary credit
                which is instead a means of payment since the buyer goes to his
                bank and asks him to pay the seller at a given moment, ie on a
                date or to the fulfillment of a condition (delivery for
                example).How does SBLC work?

                  Providers of SBLC/BG are a part of the “Secondary Market”

                  SBLC/BG Provider would often be a collateral management firm,

                  SBLC/BG must be UCP-600 compliant and hence it must be issued

                  compliant, regardless of the wording of the document. If it is
                  not UCP-600 compliant, no bank will ever accept it as

                  guarantor is obligatory, and that the issuance of said
                  documents shall be governed by the internal legislation of
                  each country. Regardless, most banks will only accept

                  discounted or funded (whereby the SBLC/BG is turned into
                  usable cash) by a resourceful Monetizer. Remember, SBLC/BG is
                  after all a written obligation of the issuing bank to pay a
                  sum on to a beneficiary on behalf of their customer in the
                  event that the customer himself does not pay the beneficiary.
                  The Instrument/ Security remains valid during the term before
                  the Expiry Date. Such resourceful Monetizers possess the
                  capacity to a draw a line of credit against “leased” SBLC/BG
                  and use part of the cash to pay the client his “Non Recourse
                  Monetization Payment” (often 40% to 65% of the value of the
                  Leased Bank Instrument known as “Loan To Value” (LTV). The
                  Monetizer then takes the balance of the money from the Line of
                  Credit and places these funds into Trade / PPP using a
                  proprietary trading platform. This platform is often a group
                  of experienced bank traders who use the Monetizers cash and
                  trade it generating significant profit returns on a weekly or
                  monthly basis. Often the Platform uses normal trading risk
                  protection strategies to ensure the Monetizers funds receive
                  significant protection from all trading downside risk.

                  Most people often confuse the term NOT RATED with the fact
                  that some SBLC/BG issuing entities are not real banks, but
                  private companies offering consulting services, and sometimes,
                  issuing documents that are beyond their legal and financial
                  capacity, hiding themselves behind the excuse that because
                  they are an “offshore bank” or a foreign corporation or
                  because they only deal with foreigners, they do not need to
                  hold a banking license or comply with reserve deposits with
                  the Central Banks of the jurisdictions from where they
                  operate. The reality is, a rating is just an opinion given by
                  one person or company, about the credibility of the bank or
                  institution what the rating is about; but this has almost
                  nothing to do with the truth, that the documents in question
                  are worthless not because of the credit rating of the issuer,
                  but because the issuer is not a bank.

                  For political reasons, most Eurozone regulated banks avoid, as
                  much as they can, to work with banks of certain countries.
                  Trying to monetize an instrument issued by a Latin American
                  country, or even China is almost impossible!! Even Europe is
                  not free of that problem; for example, while the list of
                  embargo banks from Russia and Ukraine is very small, most
                  Eurozone regulated banks prefer to not accept as collateral
                  instruments issued by any Russian or Ukraine based banks, they
                  say it is to reduce their risks as much as possible, and to
                  avoid working with banks that while not currently on the
                  embargo list, can be included in said list at any time. Some
                  other countries have strong, reliable and highly praised banks
                  with excellent credit ratings, like Azerbaijan, yet almost no
                  Eurozone regulated bank wants to work with instruments issued
                  by them; this limits the ability of most monetizers to work
                  with instruments from banks of these countries regardless of
                  the credit rating of the bank.

                  To determine if a borrower is worthy of an SBLC/BG, many banks
                  will undertake a credit analysis. Credit analyses focus on the
                  ability of the organization to meet its debt obligations,
                  focusing on default risk. Lenders will generally work through
                  the five C’s to determine credit risk: the applicant’s credit
                  history, capacity to repay, its’ capital, the loan’s
                  conditions, and associated collateral. This form of due
                  diligence can revolve around liquidity and solvency ratios.
                  Liquidity measures the ease with which an individual or
                  company can meet its financial obligations with the current
                  assets available to them, while solvency measures its ability
                  to repay long-term debts. Specific liquidity ratios a credit
                  analyst may use to determine short-term vitality are current
                  ratio, quick ratio or acid test, and cash ratio. Solvency
                  ratios might entail the interest coverage ratio.

                If client is a developer that is seeking for financing or
                funding to develop a real estate project, we could assist
                client. Client as the developer can “lease” an instrument from
                us (really this is not a lease, this is an issuance on client’s
                behalf) and the instrument might or might not be able to be used
                as collateral for a loan for client’s project. It heavily
                depends on how we issue the instrument. In some scenarios we (or
                one of our many partners) will allow for an instrument to be
                issued on client’s behalf that may have the ability to be
                “cashed” or “called” on-demand (usually this is done as
                collateral for a loan). This would be a fully cash-backed SBLC
                (drafted with “site draft”), would be fully unencumbered, and
                shall be issued to client’s benefit (or benefit of the lender).
                In this case, we would require some sort of collateral or joint
                venture. Please kindly contact us for more details. Other
                scenarios the SBLC shall be issued for “Credit Enhancement”
                purposes (in these scenarios the instrument would not be able to
                be cashed or called), however client would not be allowed to use
                this to deceive or defraud a bank. If client is asked about the
                origination of the instrument we demand that client is honest
                and upright with the bank or lender.
