              The TrendinGap scam typically involves fake brokers who promise
              high returns on investment, only to disappear with the investor’s
              money. These brokers use various tactics to gain the trust of
              their victims, such as offering free courses or investment advice.
              Once they have gained the victim’s trust, they convince them to
              invest more money, promising even higher returns. Eventually, the
              broker disappears, and the victim is left with nothing. TrendinGap

              victims. They often use fake profiles and aliases to avoid
              detection. Once they have made contact with a victim, they will
              use various tactics to gain their trust, such as promising high
              returns on investment or offering free investment advice.

              them to invest even more money. Victims of TrendinGap scam often
              feel embarrassed and ashamed of falling for the scam, which makes
